                <li><strong>Aerosolized Vomit Particles:</strong> Tiny particles can become airborne when an infected person vomits.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>

                <li>Symptoms appear <strong>12 to 48 hours</strong> after exposure.</li>
                <li>The illness lasts <strong>1 to 3 days</strong>, but shedding of the virus can continue for <strong>up to 2 weeks</strong>.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- 🔶 Symptom Severity Scale -->
            <h2 class="mt-4">Symptom Severity Scale</h2>
            <div class="mb-4">
                <p>Use this simple scale to identify how serious your symptoms are:</p>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Complications of Norovirus</h2>
            <p>While norovirus usually resolves on its own, severe cases may lead to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Severe Dehydration:</strong> May require hospitalization, especially for young children and elderly individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Electrolyte Imbalance:</strong> Loss of essential minerals can cause dizziness and irregular heartbeat.</li>
                <li><strong>Malnutrition:</strong> Persistent vomiting and diarrhea can lead to nutrient deficiencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Secondary Infections:</strong> Weakened immunity may make individuals vulnerable to other infections.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="mt-4">Diagnosis & Testing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clinical Diagnosis:</strong> Based on symptoms, especially during outbreaks.</li>
                <li><strong>Laboratory Testing:</strong> Stool samples can confirm norovirus in severe cases.</li>
            </ul>
